# A Dungeon Master's Guide to Neverwinter

This guide was created to provide DMs with the necessary information about Neverwinter as it exists for the Fifth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons, particularly in the early 1490s DR. If you're here, it likely means you would like to contribute to this guide in some way - either by correcting some information or adding content.

# How Do I Work With This Guide

*A Dungeon Master's Guide to Neverwinter* is written in Markdown - specifically, in a format so that it works with [EncounterPlus's Module Packer](https://github.com/encounterplus/module-packer) or the corresponding [EncounterPlus Markdown Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacobJohnston.encounterplus-markdown) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

If you would like to contribute a simple fix for a typo or recommend a simple change, then these tools are absolutely not necessary. Markdown is a simple text file, and you can use whatever text editor you would like. However, if you would like to modify the document in a substantial way, or rebuild the document PDF/Module with modifications, then you will want to install one of these tools.
